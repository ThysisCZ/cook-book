Recipe Manager
==============

This application allows you to create recipes and keep track of favourite ingredients that are currently available in your food storages.

Main features
------------------------------
*   Recipes can be added to the recipe section and ingredients to the ingredient section through the dashboard
*   Each recipe contains a list of ingredients that are required
*   You can see the required amount and also availability, which depends on the amount of an available ingredient
*   If you set an amount value to 0 while adding a new ingredient to the ingredient section, its availability is displayed as "unavailable" in a recipe

Editing
---------------------------------------
*   Each recipe and favourite ingredient that you want to keep track of includes a pencil icon in the top right corner
*   Editing is useful when you used ingredients in a recipe and want to update your storage status
*   This also allows you to correct potential mistakes you made while creating a recipe or filling in information about an ingredient that you want to keep track of for future cooking

Searching

*   You can search for recipes by typing in keywords of ingredients that your desired recipe requires
*   You can use this feature to quickly find recipes in a long list based on ingredients that you want to currently use
